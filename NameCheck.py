Instructions:
1.  Predict what the program will do. Check your
    prediction by running the program a few times
    and entering a variety of names.
2.  What name do you need to enter to see the message
    "Welcome Jimbo, I hope you have a great day!"?
3.  Try entering the name "jimbo". What happens? Why?
4.  Modify the program so that it checks for your name
    and prints the message with your name instead of
    Jimbo's.
