'''
Guest List
1/4/2023
Python I

Instructions:
Run the program and try entering a variety
of names. What happens? Why? When you enter
the name "Jimbo", did you notice that the
program says that he is both on and off the
guest list? Why does this happen? How might
we modify the program to fix this issue?
